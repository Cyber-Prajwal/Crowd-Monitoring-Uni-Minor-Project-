# Crowd-Monitoring-Uni-Minor-Project-
With this Python program we attempted to study the effect of our university's flap gates on student movement, and how it affects the same. With the program you can monitor number of people, how long they stay in the frame, their path trace until they leave the frame and display a "CROWDED!!" alert if its getting too crowded.
